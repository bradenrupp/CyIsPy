I. Rationale:  
The course is the first in the two course track on programming and development. The course exposes students to contemporary advanced business application environments and languages. Students pursuing a more technical route in the MIS major chooses this track. Programming acumen and willingness to put in time and effort to learn exciting and new options contribute to success in this track. 

II. Course Aims and Outcomes:  
Aims
Knowing how to code (program) empowers you to undertake many new and interesting projects  such as data driven decision support systems (business analytics), perform near real time data analysis, build prediction systems, and many others. Most importantly, you gain in-depth knowledge of the technologies shaping your future. Diversity in programming languages is a benefit you will enjoy as it helps you understand the differences and similarities among languages and enables you to make the right choice when needed. In general, at the end of the course you should be able to design, build, and deploy applications that enhances your decision making skills. 

Specific Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: 

1.	Describe the basic elements of the Python language and the Python interpreter and discuss the differences between Python and other modern languages.
2.	Design, implement, test, and debug functions and methods that can be used in programs, and demonstrate the way parameters are passed in such functions and methods.
3.	Write classes to demonstrate the ideas of encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces and object oriented program design.
4.	Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: string processing, numeric computation, simple I/O, arrays and the Python standard library.
5.	Solve problems that have origins in a variety of disciplines including math, science, the Internet and business.
6.	Implement basics of everything that is needed to use Python for Data Science, from the language itself, to numerical computing or plotting.

III. Format and Procedures:  
Class will be a combination of in class work, lectures, and discussions. 
Laptops:
Laptops, tablets, and phones are allowed insofar as they are used for note taking or programming tasks. All other uses (e.g., for social networking) are not allowed.
IV. My Assumptions
This is a course about the practice of programming, an attempt to expose students to the development of real programs. Programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves and others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications. Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects.

Students are expected to be comfortable writing code with an object oriented programming language as well as working with an IDE for development. 

V. Course Requirements:  

1.	Class attendance and participation policy:  
The class will mainly be a hands-on, do it, and show it type. Therefore, attendance and participation is required. Up to 10 percent of your course grade will depend on you being there! Unexcused absences will be noted and penalized. Multiple unexcused absences will result in failing grade regardless of other performance.
2.	Individual programming tasks:
Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process. Individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with friends are encouraged. However, when the time comes to write the code that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer appropriate -- the program must be your own work (although you may ask teaching assistants for help in debugging). If you have a question about how to use some language or operating system feature, you can certainly ask your friends or the teaching assistants. The course newsgroup (look for announcement) is also intended for sharing insights on the meaning of questions, terminology, and so on.
Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's program for an assignment. Writing code for use by another person or using another person's code in any form violates the University's academic regulations.

Examples of unacceptable behavior for assignments include:

•	Copying any part of another person's program into your code. The only exception here is code given to you in the assignment directories or explicitly approved in the assignment.
•	Working or collaborating with another student after either of you has started writing code.
•	Consulting or using assignment solutions from any previous offering of this course.
•	Helping another student to do any of the above.
The program you turn in must be your work. You may get help from the instructor or a TA after you have started writing code, but not from other students. Computer science assignments are not like physics or math problem sets: there is no single right answer. Each student is expected to come up with his or her own individual solution.

If you plan to do something that you are not absolutely sure is legal, ask first. Ignorance of this policy will not be accepted as an excuse for your actions.

You are responsible for ensuring that your files are not readable by your classmates. We recommend doing your MIS 407 assignments on your own machine or in a private subdirectory, i.e.:

	% mkdir MIS407
	% chmod 700 MIS407
There will be a programming assignment every week during the first half of the semester. Allocate at least 5-6 hours per each assignment.

3.	Group programming task (Project):
Projects will often use open source code and other publicly available material as building blocks or as the basis for modification and adaptation. This is permitted and indeed encouraged, but such code must be properly attributed, and the project as a whole must be substantially your own work. Please consult with the instructor if you are uncertain about a proposed course of action.

Project groups are encouraged to share insights and information about how things work, how to get things done, and other aspects of programming knowledge. 

Project work will commence in the second half of the semester. A project group may have three members. The project will involve a good amount of design and implementation.

2. Course readings:  
 	(a) Required text: 
1.	Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python (Pragmatic Programmers) [Paperback] Jennifer Campbell (Author), Paul Gries (Author), Jason Montojo (Author), Greg Wilson (Author) 
2.	Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython [Paperback] Wes McKinney (Author)

(b) There will be other resources made available throughout the semester.


V. Grading Procedures: Grades for the different credit options will be based on:
•	Assignments: 40%
•	Project: 50%
•	Attendance: 10%

Late submission of assignments, though not encouraged, will be penalized on a sliding scale.
•	Up to 12 hours late – 10% reduction
•	Up to 24 hours late – 25% reduction
•	Up to 48 hours late – 50% reduction
•	Over 48 hours late – 100% reduction

Project will have frequent checkpoints and milestones along the way. You are expected to prepare status reports, preliminary designs, etc. The final project must be demonstrated and final write up including test and evaluation of the project must be submitted. Project reports will be graded.

The project grade will be shared equally among the members. Lack of contributions from any member will be assessed using team evaluation measures and will be applied to their shared grade. 

All assignments and project requirements must be completed to pass the course. 

VI. Academic Integrity
Academic Dishonesty
The class will follow Iowa State University’s policy on academic dishonesty.  Anyone suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students Office.
http://www.dso.iastate.edu/ja/academic/misconduct.html. [Optional: For this course, collaboration is allowed in the following instances: list instances.]

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy. 

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action. 

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

VII. Accommodations for students with disabilities
Disability Accommodation
Iowa State University complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Sect 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  If you have a disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please contact (instructor name) to set up a meeting within the first two weeks of the semester or as soon as you become aware of your need.  Before meeting with (instructor name), you will need to obtain a SAAR form with recommendations for accommodations from the Disability Resources Office, located in Room 1076 on the main floor of the Student Services Building. Their telephone number is 515-294-7220 or email disabilityresources@iastate.edu .  Retroactive requests for accommodations will not be honored.

Dead Week
This class follows the Iowa State University Dead Week policy as noted in section 10.6.4 of the Faculty Handbook http://www.provost.iastate.edu/resources/faculty-handbook .

VIII. Harassment and Discrimination
Iowa State University strives to maintain our campus as a place of work and study for faculty, staff, and students that is free of all forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based upon race, ethnicity, sex (including sexual assault), pregnancy, color, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or status as a U.S. veteran. Any student who has concerns about such behavior should contact his/her instructor, Student Assistance at 515-294-1020 or email dso-sas@iastate.edu, or the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance at 515-294-7612.

Religious Accommodation
If an academic or work requirement conflicts with your religious practices and/or observances, you may request reasonable accommodations. Your request must be in writing, and your instructor or supervisor will review the request.  You or your instructor may also seek assistance from the Dean of Students Office or the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance.

X. Additional Resource Readings on Programming 

These are books that I think worth reading, for enrichment or for good practical advice, or both.
The Mythical Man Month, Fred Brooks. The great classic of software engineering, one of the few computer science books that repays frequent reading.
Code Complete, 2nd edition, Steve McConnell. McConnell gives practical advice, clearly derived from real experience, in all his books. Code Complete is for individual programmers. His books on software project management, Rapid Development and Software Project Survival Guide, are also well much worth reading if you ever become involved in any kind of software project. The MIS 407 project planning is based in part on ideas derived from these books.
Writing Solid Code, Steve Maguire. This is a good shorter companion for McConnell's Code Complete, also full of good advice.
Rocket Surgery Made Easy, Steve Krug. In spite of its cutesy and misleading title, this is a useful (and very short) book on user interfaces; the sub-title, "The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems", more or less describes it. I will try to incorporate some of its advice into the project requirements.
Building Secure Software, John Viega and Gary McGraw, Addison-Wesley, 2001. Very practical guide to doing things better, especially for C programmers. Writing Secure Code (2nd edition), Michael Howard and David LeBlanc, Microsoft Press, 2002. A more Microsoft-focused take on the same problem, and a nice complement to Viega and McGraw.
Programming Pearls, 2nd edition, Jon Bentley. Lots of good insight into how to approach programming tasks, with an emphasis on algorithms.
Go To ..., by Steve Lohr, relates some really interesting material about people who have made major contributions to software, from languages and tools to operating systems, written for the layman. It seems very accurate in the places where I know the story, and it's often fascinating.
Using GitHub for projects. See http://lifehacker.com/5983680/how-the-heck-do-i-use-github.
